Welcome to Sort Visualizer! This is a static website that allows you to visualize various sorting algorithms in action. Whether you're a computer science student or just someone curious about how sorting algorithms work, this tool will help you understand their inner workings.

## Features

- Visualize sorting algorithms: The website provides a visual representation of various sorting algorithms, allowing you to see how they rearrange elements in real time.
- Multiple sorting algorithms: Choose from a variety of popular sorting algorithms, including Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and more.
- Adjustable speed: Control the speed of the visualization to observe the sorting process at your desired pace.
- Customizable array size: Adjust the size of the array to be sorted to observe how the algorithms perform with different input sizes.
- Responsive design: The website is designed to be responsive and works well on different devices and screen sizes.
