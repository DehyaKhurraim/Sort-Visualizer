# Sort-Visualizer
Sorting algorithms are methods for organizing various types of data. We use a variety of sorting algorithms, but each method has a certain role to play and significance. Our sorting visualizer displays several sorting algorithms that have been visually implemented.
Following sorting algorithms are implemented:
 Bubble sort
 Insertion sort
 Quick sort
 Merge Sort
 Heap Sort
 Court sort
 Radix Sort
 Bucket Sort

First, each button is connected to the visualization of the algorithm. On each visualization page, a timer displays the amount of time an algorithm took to sort the data. We are able to visualize the temporal complexity of each method thanks to this.
On VS code, our sorting visualizer operates. To implement it, we utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. File Handling via DOM was used to sort the data, and bars with heights corresponding to the numbers they represented were utilized to display the graphic. For illustrating the operation of algorithms like swapping and traversing, we have employed a variety of color schemes.
